# Marching Squares
Marching Squares is a simple implementation of the marching squares algorithm for generating 2D isosurfaces. This project provides a clear and basic implementation in Python that allows users to create and visualize isosurfaces from 2D scalar fields.

## Features
This project includes two versions:

### 2D Version
The 2D version is designed to create a closed curve and approximate it using the marching squares procedure. It comes with an example of a regular polygon, and additional examples may require adjustments to the code for proper execution.

### 3D Version (Marching Cubes)
The 3D version implements the marching cubes algorithm, similar to the 2D version but with the goal of approximating surfaces. In this case, I utilized the 3D version to approximate a donut. This involves creating the surface of a sphere and then taking the shape of a cylinder in the center of the sphere.
